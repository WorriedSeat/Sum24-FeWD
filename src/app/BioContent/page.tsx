                    I was born in Volzhsky, Volgogradskaya Oblast, Russia. Throughout my childhood, I engaged in various sports
                    including Judo, Football, Break-dance, and Volleyball. My academic pursuits also extended beyond the classroom; 
                    I began studying the English language at the age of five, albeit with intermittent breaks. 
                    Additionally, I delved into the field of robototechnics for two years and developed a 
                    passion for programming from the ninth grade onwards. My self-taught journey in Python continued up until 
                    the preparation for the Russian State Exam.

                    Upon completing high school, I chose to further my education at 
                    Innopolis University. The learning environment here is both challenging and engaging. Balancing my studies with physical 
                    fitness, I dedicate most of my time to academics and gym workouts. However, I occasionally travel back home or to Moscow
                    to spend quality time with my friends and family.

                    My primary interest lies in programming, particularly in backend 
                    development and artificial intelligence. Beyond coding, I find joy in creative endeavors such as sketching.
